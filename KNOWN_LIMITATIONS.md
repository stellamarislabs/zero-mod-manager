# Known Limitations — 0.6.5

- 7z and RAR installation uses the open-source 7-Zip command-line program
  available on the host. ZIP support is built in. The tool is looked for on
  `PATH`, in the standard 7-Zip and NanaZip install folders, and in the
  directory 7-Zip's installer registered; Settings takes a path for anything
  else. A missing tool produces setup guidance.
- RAR still needs a 7-Zip build carrying the RAR codec, which many omit.
- UE4SS can be installed from a package the user downloaded, but it is never
  downloaded automatically. The Nexus `nxm://` handoff can download a package
  after the user starts it on the website and configures a personal API key.
- UE4SS installation preserves `UE4SS-settings.ini`, `mods.txt`, `mods.json`,
  and every `load_order.txt`. A package shipping newer defaults for those will
  not replace an existing copy; remove yours first to adopt them.
- Applying a UE4SS start order writes the managed entries as one block directly
  before the runtime's `Keybinds` block, which Zero Company requires to remain
  last. Other comments, blank lines, and runtime-owned entries keep their
  relative order, but a managed mod that was hand-placed elsewhere moves into
  that block. Order among managed mods is preserved, and mods installed before
  this release keep the order the file already has.
- UE4SS starts DLL mods and Lua mods in two separate passes: every DLL mod runs
  as the runtime initializes, and the Lua mods only once the scripting runtime
  exists. Order is therefore settable within each pass, never across them, and
  a request to interleave them is normalized into what the runtime will do.
- UE4SS start order covers `mods.txt` only. BPModLoader keeps its own list in
  `BPModLoaderMod/load_order.txt` for blueprint mods, which the manager still
  preserves rather than writes, so blueprint load order stays manual.
- An upgrade is reversible until it succeeds, not atomic afterwards. If the new
  version deploys but recording it fails, the new files are in place and the
  error says so; the old entry is the one left behind.
- Game-folder mods are recognized from three layouts: a tree containing
  `SWZeroCompany`, a `LogicMods` blueprint pack, and a loader shim named after
  the system library it replaces (`dxgi.dll`, `dinput8.dll`, and similar) with
  the files beside it. Anything else in the archive is listed and left alone.
- A game-folder mod is the only kind that replaces an existing file. The
  original is kept in the managed library and restored on disable or removal,
  but a file another mod already owns is never overwritten.
- Existing-mod discovery adopts additive PAK/IoStore, UE4SS, and LogicMods.
  It reports but does not adopt ReShade and other replacement-style game-folder
  mods because their pre-mod originals are no longer available to back up.
- Lua mods bundled inside a UE4SS package are treated as part of the runtime
  and are overwritten on upgrade. Edits to a shipped mod's scripts are lost;
  copy it under a new folder name to keep changes.
- Steam launch options are inspected heuristically and never edited. On Linux,
  confirm `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dwmapi=n,b" %command%` manually.
- The optional custom game launcher starts the selected file with its containing
  folder as the working directory and does not add command-line arguments. On
  Linux, select a native launcher or wrapper rather than a Windows executable
  that the host cannot run directly.
- retoc can verify only containers supported by retoc 0.1.5. Encrypted or future
  game container formats may require an upstream update.
- PAK-only mods cannot provide package-level overlap metadata; only destination
  filename collision is available for them.
- Load-order management is enabled for IoStore triplets with a companion PAK,
  which passed the two-direction Zero Company runtime test. Pure UTOC/UCAS
  pairs remain visible but non-orderable because they are not independently
  verified.
- PAK-only mods remain visible but non-orderable: the local capability fixture
  did not pass the runtime gate. Their contents are also opaque, so the manager
  cannot identify which assets a PAK-only mod wins or loses.
- A FOMOD installer script is read for its options and file rules, not run. The
  format also allows conditions on other game plugins and on tool or game
  versions; Zero Company has no such plugins, so those conditions are reported
  as a visible warning and treated as unmet, and an option gated behind one is
  shown as unavailable. Version-numbered dependencies on the game or on the
  manager are treated the same way.
- An installer script the manager cannot parse is not a refusal: the archive is
  read the previous way instead, with its folders offered as labeled options.
  The same applies to a file the script names that the archive does not
  actually contain, which is skipped with a warning rather than failing the
  install.
- Option images are shown for PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, and BMP up to 4 MB each. A
  larger or differently encoded image is left out and its option still lists
  its name and description.
- A scripted install produces mod entries from the files it selected, not one
  entry per answer. Where those files form a single flat payload they become
  one mod, so re-running the installer with different answers replaces that mod
  rather than adding to it.
- Hiding a mod affects the library list only. A hidden mod is still installed,
  still deployed, still counted on Home, and still listed in the load-order and
  UE4SS start-order editors, because it still loads and its position still
  matters.
- Removing or disabling a mod prunes the empty folders its own payload created,
  but only below that mod type's deployment base and only while they are empty.
  A folder still holding a settings file, a log, or anything else the manager
  does not own is kept, and a game-folder mod is never pruned because its base
  is the game installation itself.
- Full profiles remain future work.
- Update checking needs a mod to be matched to its Nexus page. A download
  through the `nxm://` handoff records that outright. Anything else is matched
  by offering the MD5 of the archive it was installed from, which only works
  while that archive is still on disk and only for a file that was actually
  uploaded to Nexus. A mod adopted from disk, installed from an archive that has
  since been deleted, or built from source is never matched automatically and
  has to be linked by hand from More details, or it is not checked.
- An update is the newest file Nexus still offers under `MAIN` or `UPDATE`, and
  newer means a higher file id, which Nexus issues in upload order. A mod that
  publishes its releases under another category is compared against its newest
  offered file instead; an author who re-uploads an old build under a new file
  id is reported as an update.
- The update check reports that a newer file exists. It never downloads or
  installs one on its own, and a free Nexus account has to start the download
  on the website because the API will not mint a download link without the
  website's key.
- Linking a mod by hand trusts the address given. The file recorded as installed
  is the one whose version string matches the installed version, and the newest
  offered file when no version matches, so a mod whose version was never
  recorded is linked to the current file and reports an update only from the
  next release onward.
- An update check is a request per Nexus mod, plus one per unmatched archive
  that has not been excluded, so a large library spends the hourly API allowance
  quickly. A mod that is not published on Nexus is worth taking out of checking
  from More details, because its archive is otherwise offered again on every
  check the user asks for. The result stands
  for six hours before an automatic check goes back to the network; the Mods
  page button always does.
- Downloads must be started from the Nexus Mods website. A non-premium account
  cannot obtain a download link from the API without the website-minted key, so
  no in-application browsing or search is offered.
- Without a Secret Service provider on Linux, the Nexus API key is stored in the
  application database as plain text. Settings reports which location is in use.
- The `nxm://` association is claimed only when enabled in Settings, so it is
  never taken from another mod manager silently. If another manager already
  holds it, Settings names that application instead of failing quietly.
- On Linux the `nxm://` desktop entry is written by this application rather
  than by `tauri-plugin-deep-link`, which quotes `Exec`. `xdg-mime` resolves an
  entry by passing the first whitespace-separated word of `Exec` to
  `command -v` without stripping quotes, so a quoted path never resolves and
  the entry is skipped silently. Paths that genuinely need quoting are reached
  through a symbolic link instead.
- `xdg-mime query` reads `<desktop>-mimeapps.list` before the generic
  `mimeapps.list` when `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` is set, but `xdg-mime default`
  only writes the generic file. An application that claimed a scheme in the
  prefixed file keeps it regardless of later registrations, so the prefixed
  files are updated too — only where they already name the scheme, and the
  entry is removed again when the association is handed back.
- Release builds are unsigned. SmartScreen may warn on Windows.
- Flatpak/Snap sandbox permissions and uncommon portable Steam installations
  may require manual game-path selection.
- Windows artifacts are generated by GitHub Actions; they cannot be produced on
  a Linux host without a complete Windows MSVC/WiX/NSIS toolchain.
- AppImage builds on rolling distributions whose libraries use modern RELR ELF
  sections set `NO_STRIP=1`; the linuxdeploy binary embedded by Tauri otherwise
  uses an older `strip` that cannot parse those sections. Release CI also sets
  this compatibility flag.
