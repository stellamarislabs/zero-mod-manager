## Rust and JavaScript dependencies

The project uses Tauri, React, Vite, rusqlite, zip-rs, and other packages listed
exactly in `package-lock.json` and `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`. They are consumed as
unmodified dependencies under their respective permissive/open-source
licenses. Release workflows preserve both lockfiles. Run `cargo license` and
`npx license-checker` when preparing a release if those optional audit tools
are installed.
